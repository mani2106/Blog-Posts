                         Nokogiri v1.18.9 patches the vendored libxml2 to address CVE-2025-6021, CVE-2025-6170, CVE-2025-49794,
                         CVE-2025-49795, and CVE-2025-49796.

                         ## Impact and severity

                         ### CVE-2025-6021

                         A flaw was found in libxml2's xmlBuildQName function, where integer overflows in buffer size calculations can lead
                         to a stack-based buffer overflow. This issue can result in memory corruption or a denial of service when
                         processing crafted input.

                         NVD claims a severity of 7.5 High (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

                         Fixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/17d950ae

                         ### CVE-2025-6170

                         A flaw was found in the interactive shell of the xmllint command-line tool, used for parsing XML files. When a
                         user inputs an overly long command, the program does not check the input size properly, which can cause it to
                         crash. This issue might allow attackers to run harmful code in rare configurations without modern protections.

                         NVD claims a severity of 2.5 Low (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

                         ### CVE-2025-49794

                         A use-after-free vulnerability was found in libxml2. This issue occurs when parsing XPath elements under certain
                         circumstances when the XML schematron has the <sch:name path="..."/> schema elements. This flaw allows a malicious
                         actor to craft a malicious XML document used as input for libxml, resulting in the program's crash using libxml or
                         other possible undefined behaviors.

                         NVD claims a severity of 9.1 Critical (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)

                         Fixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/81cef8c5

                         ### CVE-2025-49795

                         A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in libxml2 when processing XPath XML expressions. This flaw
                         allows an attacker to craft a malicious XML input to libxml2, leading to a denial of service.

                         NVD claims a severity of 7.5 High (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

                         ### CVE-2025-49796

                         A vulnerability was found in libxml2. Processing certain sch:name elements from the input XML file can trigger a
                         memory corruption issue. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a malicious XML input file that can lead libxml to
                         crash, resulting in a denial of service or other possible undefined behavior due to sensitive data being corrupted
                         in memory.

                         NVD claims a severity of 9.1 Critical (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)

                         ## Affected Versions

                         - Nokogiri < 1.18.9 when using CRuby (MRI) with vendored libxml2

                         ## Patched Versions

                         - Nokogiri >= 1.18.9

                         ## Mitigation

                         Upgrade to Nokogiri v1.18.9 or later.

                         Users who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated mitigation: compile and link Nokogiri
                         against patched external libxml2 libraries which will also address these same issues.

                         CVE-2025-32414 and CVE-2025-32415; description=## Summary

                         Nokogiri v1.18.8 upgrades its dependency libxml2 to
                         [v2.13.8](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.13.8).

                         libxml2 v2.13.8 addresses:

                         - CVE-2025-32414
                           - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/889
                         - CVE-2025-32415
                           - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/890

                         ## Impact

                         ### CVE-2025-32414: No impact

                         In libxml2 before 2.13.8 and 2.14.x before 2.14.2, out-of-bounds memory access can occur in the Python API (Python
                         bindings) because of an incorrect return value. This occurs in xmlPythonFileRead and xmlPythonFileReadRaw because
                         of a difference between bytes and characters.

                         **There is no impact** from this CVE for Nokogiri users.


                         ### CVE-2025-32415: Low impact

                         In libxml2 before 2.13.8 and 2.14.x before 2.14.2, xmlSchemaIDCFillNodeTables in xmlschemas.c has a heap-based
                         buffer under-read. To exploit this, a crafted XML document must be validated against an XML schema with certain
                         identity constraints, or a crafted XML schema must be used.

                         In the upstream issue, further context is provided by the maintainer:

                         > The bug affects validation against untrusted XML Schemas (.xsd) and validation of untrusted
                         > documents against trusted Schemas if they make use of xsd:keyref in combination with recursively
                         > defined types that have additional identity constraints.

                         MITRE has published a severity score of 2.9 LOW (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) for this CVE.;

                         The REXML gem before 3.3.9 has a ReDoS vulnerability when it parses an XML that has many digits between `&#` and
                         `x...;` in a hex numeric character reference (`&#x...;`).

                         This does not happen with Ruby 3.2 or later. Ruby 3.1 is the only affected maintained Ruby. Note that Ruby 3.1
                         will reach EOL on 2025-03.

                         ### Patches

                         The REXML gem 3.3.9 or later include the patch to fix the vulnerability.

                         ### Workarounds

                         Use Ruby 3.2 or later instead of Ruby 3.1.

                         description=### Impact

                         The REXML gem before 3.3.6 has a DoS vulnerability when it parses an XML that has many deep elements that have
                         same local name attributes.

                         If you need to parse untrusted XMLs with tree parser API like `REXML::Document.new`, you may be impacted to this
                         vulnerability. If you use other parser APIs such as stream parser API and SAX2 parser API, this vulnerability is
                         not affected.

                         ### Patches

                         The REXML gem 3.3.6 or later include the patch to fix the vulnerability.

                         ### Workarounds

                         Don't parse untrusted XMLs with tree parser API.

                         Nokogiri v1.16.5 upgrades its dependency libxml2 to
                         [2.12.7](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.7) from 2.12.6.

                         libxml2 v2.12.7 addresses CVE-2024-34459:

                         - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/720
                         - patched by https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/2876ac53


                         ## Impact

                         There is no impact to Nokogiri users because the issue is present only in libxml2's `xmllint` tool which Nokogiri
                         does not provide or expose.

                         vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-38037.

                         Versions Affected: >= 5.2.0 Not affected: < 5.2.0 Fixed Versions: 7.0.7.1, 6.1.7.5

                         # Impact
                         ActiveSupport::EncryptedFile writes contents that will be encrypted to a temporary file. The temporary file’s
                         permissions are defaulted to the user’s current umask settings, meaning that it’s possible for other users on the
                         same system to read the contents of the temporary file.

                         Attackers that have access to the file system could possibly read the contents of this temporary file while a user
                         is editing it.

                         All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

                         # Releases
                         The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

                         # Workarounds
                         To work around this issue, you can set your umask to be more restrictive like this:

                         ```ruby

                         underscore; description=There is a possible regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Active Support. This
                         vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-22796.

                         Versions Affected: All Not affected: None Fixed Versions: 5.2.8.15 (Rails LTS, which is a paid service and not
                         part of the rubygem), 6.1.7.1, 7.0.4.1
                         Impact

                         A specially crafted string passed to the underscore method can cause the regular expression engine to enter a
                         state of catastrophic backtracking. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to
                         a possible DoS vulnerability.

                         This affects String#underscore, ActiveSupport::Inflector.underscore, String#titleize, and any other methods using
                         these.

                         All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.
                         Releases

                         The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.
                         Workarounds

                         There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.

                         Users on Ruby 3.2.0 or greater may be able to reduce the impact by configuring Regexp.timeout.
                         Patches

                         To aid users who aren’t able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.
                         They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.

                             6-1-Avoid-regex-backtracking-in-Inflector.underscore.patch - Patch for 6.1 series
                             7-0-Avoid-regex-backtracking-in-Inflector.underscore.patch - Patch for 7.0 series

                         Please note that only the 7.0.Z and 6.1.Z series are supported at present, and 6.0.Z for severe vulnerabilities.
                         Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the

                         called on a SafeBuffer with untrusted user input.
                         This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-28120.

                         Versions Affected: All. Not affected: None Fixed Versions: 7.0.4.3, 6.1.7.3

                         # Impact

                         ActiveSupport uses the SafeBuffer string subclass to tag strings as html_safe after they have been sanitized.
                         When these strings are mutated, the tag is should be removed to mark them as no longer being html_safe.

                         Ruby 3.2 introduced a new bytesplice method which ActiveSupport did not yet understand to be a mutation.
                         Users on older versions of Ruby are likely unaffected.

                         All users running an affected release and using bytesplice should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds
                         immediately.

                         # Workarounds

                         Avoid calling bytesplice on a SafeBuffer (html_safe) string with untrusted user input.
