# The Comeback: From Hiatus to Security Hardening

After a long hiatus from blogging, I decided it was time to dust off my Jekyll blog and get back to writing. But when I opened my repository, I was greeted by a concerning sight: **12 GitHub Dependabot security alerts** ranging from critical to low severity. These weren't just minor updates‚Äîsome were critical vulnerabilities with CVSS scores of 9.1 that could lead to memory corruption and use-after-free attacks.

This seemed like the perfect opportunity to not only get my blog back online securely, but also to try out a new approach I'd been exploring: **spec-driven development using Kiro**. Rather than diving straight into code changes, I decided to treat this security hardening as a proper software project with requirements, design, and implementation planning.

## Why Spec-Driven Development?

Coming back to a project after months away, I realized I needed more than just quick fixes. I needed:
- **Clear documentation** of what needed to be done and why
- **Systematic approach** to prevent breaking changes
- **Maintainable procedures** for future updates
- **Comprehensive testing strategy** to ensure nothing broke

This is where Kiro's spec-driven approach became invaluable.

## The Security Landscape

The vulnerabilities spanned across multiple critical components:

- **Nokogiri** (XML/HTML parser): 5 alerts including critical memory corruption issues
- **REXML** (XML parser): 6 alerts mostly related to Denial of Service attacks
- **ActiveSupport** (Rails component): 1 alert for potential file disclosure

Here's what I was facing:

### Critical Priority üö®
- **CVE-2025-49794, CVE-2025-49796**: Use-after-free and memory corruption in Nokogiri (CVSS 9.1)

### High Priority ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **CVE-2025-24855, CVE-2024-55549**: Use-after-free in libxslt
- **CVE-2024-43398**: REXML DoS vulnerability with deep XML elements

### Medium Priority üìã
- Multiple REXML DoS vulnerabilities
- ActiveSupport file disclosure vulnerability

## The Spec-Driven Approach with Kiro

Instead of randomly updating gems, I used Kiro to develop a structured methodology through proper specification:

### 1. Requirements Gathering
Using Kiro, I started by creating a comprehensive requirements document that captured:
- **User stories** for each type of security concern
- **Acceptance criteria** in EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- **Priority matrix** based on vulnerability severity
- **Success metrics** for the security hardening

```markdown
**User Story:** As a blog maintainer, I want to analyze the current GitHub
security alerts for my gem dependencies, so that I can prioritize which
vulnerabilities need immediate attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN analyzing GitHub alerts THEN the system SHALL categorize
   vulnerabilities by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are categorized THEN the system SHALL identify
   which gems require updates
```

### 2. Design Document
Kiro helped me create a detailed design that outlined:
- **Vulnerability analysis framework** with three-phase approach
- **Gem upgrade mapping** with version constraints
- **Dependency resolution strategy** to prevent conflicts
- **Error handling scenarios** and rollback procedures

### 3. Implementation Planning
The spec process generated a detailed task breakdown:
- 8 major phases with 15 sub-tasks
- Each task linked to specific requirements
- Clear validation steps for each phase
- Rollback procedures documented upfront

### 4. Baseline Documentation
Through the spec process, I systematically documented the current state:
- Ruby 2.7.1 (approaching EOL)
- Jekyll 4.1.1 (outdated)
- Bundler 2.1.4 (incompatible with modern Ruby)
- Multiple outdated gems with restrictive version constraints

### 5. Priority-Based Upgrade Strategy
The design phase helped me categorize updates by security impact and dependency relationships:

```ruby
# Phase 1: Ruby runtime upgrade
Ruby 2.7.1 ‚Üí Ruby 3.3.9

# Phase 2: Critical security gems
nokogiri: "< 1.18.9" ‚Üí "~> 1.18.0"
rexml: "< 3.3.9" ‚Üí "~> 3.4.0"

# Phase 3: Major framework updates
activesupport: "< 6.1.7.5" ‚Üí "~> 7.2.0"

# Phase 4: Supporting infrastructure
faraday: "< 1.0" ‚Üí "~> 2.12.0"
```

### 3. Constraint Optimization
One major issue was overly restrictive version constraints that prevented security updates:

```ruby
# Before: Blocking security updates
gem "faraday", "< 1.0"  # Stuck on 0.17.5 from 2019!

# After: Security-friendly constraints
gem "faraday", "~> 2.12"  # Allows patch updates
```

## The Implementation Journey: Spec to Code

With Kiro's comprehensive spec in hand, the implementation became straightforward. Each task was clearly defined with acceptance criteria, making it easy to know exactly what needed to be done and how to validate success.

### Task-by-Task Execution
The beauty of the spec-driven approach was that I could work through each task systematically:

```markdown
- [x] 1. Establish baseline and prepare for upgrades
- [x] 2. Upgrade Ruby version to latest stable
- [x] 3. Update critical security gems (Nokogiri and REXML)
- [x] 4. Update ActiveSupport to latest Rails 7.x series
- [x] 5. Update supporting gems to latest versions
- [x] 6. Optimize Gemfile version constraints for security
- [x] 7. Comprehensive testing and validation
- [x] 8. Document changes and create maintenance procedures
```

### Ruby Version Upgrade
Following the spec's Phase 1, the foundation needed to be solid. Ruby 2.7.1 was approaching end-of-life and causing bundler compatibility issues:

```dockerfile
# Before
FROM jekyll/jekyll:4.1.0  # Ruby 2.7.1

# After
FROM ruby:3.3-alpine     # Ruby 3.3.9
```

This single change resolved multiple compatibility issues and enabled modern gem versions.

### Critical Security Updates

**Nokogiri: The Big One**
Nokogiri had the most severe vulnerabilities, including critical memory corruption issues:

```ruby
# Updated from 1.16.3 to 1.18.10
gem "nokogiri", "~> 1.18"
```

This update resolved 5 security alerts, including the critical CVE-2025-49794 and CVE-2025-49796.

**REXML: DoS Protection**
REXML had 6 different Denial of Service vulnerabilities:

```ruby
# Updated from 3.2.5 to 3.4.4
gem "rexml", "~> 3.4"
```

**ActiveSupport: Major Version Jump**
The most challenging update was ActiveSupport, requiring a major version upgrade:

```ruby
# 6.0.6.1 ‚Üí 7.2.2.2 (major version jump)
gem "activesupport", "~> 7.2"
```

Surprisingly, this major version upgrade had zero breaking changes for Jekyll usage‚Äîa testament to Rails' commitment to backward compatibility.

## Testing and Validation

Each phase included comprehensive testing:

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Build verification
bundle install
jekyll build

# Functionality testing
docker-compose up -d
curl -I http://localhost:4000
```

### Manual Verification
- ‚úÖ All blog posts render correctly
- ‚úÖ Math equations display properly (KaTeX)
- ‚úÖ Code syntax highlighting works
- ‚úÖ RSS feed generates correctly
- ‚úÖ SEO tags are present
- ‚úÖ Site navigation functions

## The Results

### Security Impact
