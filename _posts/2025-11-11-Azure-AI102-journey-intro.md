# Introduction
I recently decided to take the Azure AI-102 exam, So I thought I would share my learnings from Day 1 of my preparation journey. The full learning plan is quite detailed and can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification)

[Study guide](https://aka.ms/ai102-StudyGuide) can also be found which explains a lot of what skills are measured and what to expect in the exam.

# Practice assessment
Firstly I took a practice assessment directly in which I scored less than the recommended amount, so it generated a customised learning plan to help me pass the exam.

**Recommended modules included**

- Plan and prepare to develop AI solutions on Azure

- Create an Azure AI Search solution

I’ll post detailed notes on the first recommended module in my next update, including key takeaways and hands-on resources. Follow along for progress updates.
