# 7 Machine Learning Production Mistakes That Cost Us $50K

Last year, our ML team made several costly mistakes when deploying models to production. Here's what went wrong and how you can avoid the same pitfalls.

## Mistake #1: No Data Drift Monitoring ($15K Loss)

We deployed a customer churn prediction model that worked perfectly in testing. Six months later, we discovered it was making terrible predictions because customer behavior had shifted during the pandemic.

**The Fix:** Implement data drift monitoring from day one. Monitor feature distributions, prediction confidence, and business metrics.

## Mistake #2: Ignoring Model Bias ($12K Loss)

Our hiring recommendation model showed bias against certain demographic groups. We only discovered this after a candidate complained, leading to legal fees and reputation damage.

**The Fix:** Test for bias across all protected characteristics. Use fairness metrics like demographic parity and equalized odds.

## Mistake #3: Poor Feature Engineering Pipeline ($8K Loss)

Our feature pipeline broke silently, feeding the model stale data for weeks. The model kept running but made increasingly poor predictions.

**The Fix:** Add comprehensive monitoring to your feature pipeline. Alert on missing data, stale features, and unexpected distributions.

## Mistake #4: No A/B Testing Framework ($7K Loss)

We deployed a new recommendation algorithm to all users at once. When conversion rates dropped 15%, we had no way to quickly roll back or understand the impact.

**The Fix:** Always deploy ML models with proper A/B testing. Start with a small percentage of traffic and gradually increase.

## Mistake #5: Inadequate Model Versioning ($5K Loss)

When our model started performing poorly, we couldn't quickly identify which version was causing issues or roll back to a previous version.

**The Fix:** Implement proper ML model versioning with tools like MLflow or DVC. Track model artifacts, code, and data versions together.

## Mistake #6: Missing Business Logic Validation ($2K Loss)

Our pricing model occasionally suggested negative prices due to edge cases we hadn't considered during training.

**The Fix:** Add business logic validation to all model outputs. Set reasonable bounds and sanity checks.

## Mistake #7: No Explainability for Stakeholders ($1K Loss)

When stakeholders questioned model decisions, we couldn't explain why the model made specific predictions, leading to loss of trust.

**The Fix:** Implement model explainability tools like SHAP or LIME. Create dashboards that business users can understand.

## The Real Cost

The financial cost was significant, but the real damage was to team morale and stakeholder trust. It took months to rebuild confidence in our ML systems.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Monitor everything** - data, models, and business metrics
2. **Test for bias** early and often
3. **Start small** with A/B testing
4. **Version everything** - models, data, and code
5. **Add guardrails** with business logic validation
6. **Make models explainable** from the start
7. **Build trust** through transparency and reliability

## Moving Forward

We've since implemented a comprehensive ML ops framework that prevents these issues. Our models are more reliable, our stakeholders trust our work, and we sleep better at night.
